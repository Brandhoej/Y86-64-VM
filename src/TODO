 + Better printing with rsp and rbp
 + Better memory printing with columns
 + Better register printing
 + Better flag printing
 + Print staus code
 + Print PC
 + Branch instructions
 + Move the program inside the memory
 + Make PC counter a QuadWord value (Not pointer to chunk opCode)
 + High and low memory -> https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2010/fall/cs301/lecture/10_06_the_stack.html check
 + Instead of M8 by default caused by using Quads then i want byte addressable memory Where i can use M1 M8
 + Stack like printing for the stack (like the memory and register)
 + Instructions
 - Make registers byte addressable instead of using quads.
 - Memory profilling
 + Document caller and callee registers
 - Make printing row mayor instead of column mayor for both registers and memory. 
    When printing 16 reg there with 2 columns then there are two empties
    in the same leftmost column this could instead be done by removing a row.
 - Dynamic array memory
 - Verify with CUTEST
